* Update license to Apache 2.0

v1.2.1
------
* Support Sinabs 2.0
* Support individual time constants

v1.1.2
------
* Update README
* Enable backpropagation through v_mem and gradients wrt. v_mem_init for
Integrate-and-Fire and Leaky layers. This also makes sure that gradients are
correct when backpropagating through multiple forward calls.
* Bugfix in gradient of Leaky layer wrt to alpha when v_mem_init is not 0.

v1.1.1
------
* Make sure discontinuous gradients are handled properly during backward
calls.

v1.1.0
------

* Prepend string representation of EXODUS objects with 'EXODUS'
* In IAF layers `tau_mem` now evaluates to `None` (formerly inf)
* Convenience functions `exodus_to_sinabs` and `sinabs_to_exodus` for
converting between Sinabs/EXODUS backends
* Dependency on Sinabs v1.1.1

v1.0.1
------
* Update README
