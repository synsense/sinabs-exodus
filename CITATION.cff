abstract: >-
  Sinabs-exodus is a plugin to the sinabs spiking neural
  network library. It can provide massive speedups in
  training and inference on GPU.


  The tool is based on EXODUS, a formulation of
  backpropagation-through-time with surrogate gradients,
  that allows for efficient parallelization. EXODUS stands
  for EXact calculation Of Derivatives as Update to SLAYER.
  It builds upon the SLAYER algorithm, but uses
  mathematically accurate gradients and tends to be more
  robust to surrogate gradient scaling, making training less
  prone to suffer from exploding or vanishing gradients.
